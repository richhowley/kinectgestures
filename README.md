Kinect gesture engine demo using XML to define gestures

Kinect gestures are defined in a XML file.  The file is read at runtime and the application determines what actions to take when gestures are completed.  Create in Visual Studio Express 2012 using Openframeworks with the ofxKinect2 addon.


The src directory contains all the source files needed for the project.  The data directory, which should be in the Openframeworks bin directory, contains the XML files that defines a few simple gestures.
